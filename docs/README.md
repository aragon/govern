Welcome to Aragon Govern's documentation.

Aragon Govern is software for creating and governing organizations such as DeFi projects, open source projects, gaming guilds, cooperatives, nonprofits, clubs, companies, and any other type of organization you can imagine. It's Aragon's implementation of ERC-3000, the standard for binding off-chain voting.

Along with off-chain voting solutions like [Snapshot](https://snapshot.page/#/) it allows you to _govern_ all parts of your project, even if not completely decentralized, in an easy manner. also allowing for flexibility and extensions when needed.

* The [**High Level Overview**](guides/core-concepts.md) section provides more insight over Govern and all of its tooling.
* The [**Developers**](developers/quick-start.md) section gives an overview of all the individual pieces of Govern.
